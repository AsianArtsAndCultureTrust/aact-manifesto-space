    bio: 'Love Intersections is a media arts collective made up of queer artists of colour dedicated to using collaborative art making and relational storytelling to address systemic racism in our communities. We produce intersectional and intergenerational stories from underrepresented communities of colour – centering the invisible, the spiritual, the metaphysical, and the imaginary. We believe in deep and meaningful relationships, that intersectionality is a verb and a call to action, that we must cultivate social trust through collective care and community responsibility.

    description: "This video installation employs the metaphor of the Chinese Five Elements to explore the discursive formation of queer Chinese diasporic identity from a non-Eurocentric/Western point of departure. In Traditional Chinese Medicine, the Five Elemental forces provide many applications to understanding daily life, identity, and relationships in addition to physical, mental, and emotional health. The elements help to approach and understand ways of “being” through principles of metaphysics and temporalities. We invoke these five elements in this installation as a conduit to understanding queer East Asian cultural formations, not as an intellectual delineation, but to interpret our own embodiment of queer Chinese, diasporic identities.\n" +
        "\n" +
        "We performed an ancestral veneration ceremony at Larwill Park in Vancouver, which was the gathering site of the anti-Oriental riots of 1907 to mark an image of the temporal relationship that the project Yellow Peril: Queer Destiny has amongst a history of anti-Asian racism in Canada.  Giving offerings to our ancestors, reflecting on histories of colonization, founded upon systemic racism, and recognizing that these formations of anti-Asian racism and yellow peril exist to uphold imperialism - and never really goes away. Drawing on Simeon Mann and Dylan Rodriguez, Anti-Asian racism emerges when there’s an insecurity around the capitalist mode of production predicated on the seizure and extraction of Indigenous lands, and that anti-Asian violence is a structure to sustain racial devices inherent in racial capitalism and settler colonialism.\n" +
        "\n" +
        "Race, temporality, ancestry, and relationships to land are themes that we grapple with in this project. A core part of our recent practice as queer Chinese artists is exploring the relationship between our identities as queer Asian artists and how our anti-racist arts practice can work in solidarity with struggles to decolonize. We are particularly interested in the recent (re)emergence of Anti-Asian racism and community (and governmental) responses that lean towards identity based politics. We are interested in creating works that address systemic racism and colonization, and the roles that queer Chinese people play in undoing anti-Black and anti-Indigenous racism.",

I see this as an act of interventionism: a queering of what has come before that conveys questionable practices of writing over the past. Perhaps it is a simple act of convenience on the part of business owners, but it demonstrates the enactment of a suspension in time that signifies how a singular space or parcel of land remains fixed to its physical location yet carries a multitude of meanings, purposes, and histories.\n" +

        "With this in mind, I explore public signs as an active form of cross-generational communication, where signs inform and encourage viewers to participate and engage with their community while also becoming meaningful social stamps whose significance is shaped and derived by its audience. In this artwork, the restaurant awnings function in the way that printed matter “insist[s] on […] encounter[s]” by taking inspiration from Josh MacPhee who states that “[signs] gesture beyond the text on a page to a more-than, to publics to come. Banner making is a similar form of public/ation that is both community driven and a form of communication.”\n" +
        "\n" +
        "Performing in parallel with Rebecca Solnit’s reflections on posters and artistic projects involving “public/ations”, my work acknowledges how temporal signs define and lay claim to physical spaces and inspire viewers to think of the past, present, and future not as a linear timeline but a continuous social project that is constantly being written. As stated by Stephanie Springgay in Feltness:\n" +
        "\n" +
        "The vitality of street posters [...] ‘when the walls wake up, they remind us of who we are, where we are . . .  that we are not alone, that others have gone before, and hope remains ahead’ (18). In an era of eroded public space, protest posters become ‘small gestures,’ [...] that keep alive the power of revolution and hope in the public sphere.\n" +
        "\n" +
        "What might initially be read as carelessness or laziness may actually be the complete opposite. Instead, the layering of signs could be an example of how one can care for those that came before, serving as a reminder that there will always be someone or something preceding or coming after. The question then becomes: How do we care for those who have yet to arrive while thanking the ones who paved desire lines for us to flourish in the various gestures we make everyday?",

My idea of resilience and dedication was shaped by my mother and the environment around us. I saw her selfless commitment to what she cares about, and so like my mother, I have a sense of responsibility and give care earnestly. I’m aware of the physical toll and the always-present guilt of not doing or being enough, but I would rather be like that than not to help.\n" +

    description: "Mother’s Tongue is a temporal sculpture and prose reflecting on the ever-changing nature of memory, identity, and tradition. Created in 2020 during a time of instability and discomfort, the tandem pieces explore finding solace in tradition, ritual, and food. This piece was originally conceived as a way to connect with my cultural ancestors but upon reevaluation, I recognize now I was also searching for connection with my queer ancestors. \n" +

        "Mother’s Tongue is a manifestation of my discomfort with my queer identity. The sculpture consists of polymer clay dumplings encased in gelatine. The unstable fluid materiality of the gelatine captures my relationship to my queerness while the encased clay dumplings are representative of my Asian identity. The two identities are frequently at odds with one another, existing in a state of suspension and tension. From the material tension of the sculpture to the underlying tension within my writing, both forms are trying to contain the multitudes of what is undefinable, capturing a moment in time and suspending it in space. \n" +
